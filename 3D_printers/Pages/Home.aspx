    <p>The newest way to print quality 3D models right from your desk for visualisation, collaboration, and functional prototyping testing.</p>

<p>The new UP Mini Desktop 3D Printer is simple and affordable. Using additive manufacturing technology to lay down successive layers of ABS to build up a printed three dimensional model. 3D Print whatever you want, whenever you want and as any times as you want.</p>
<p>The printer is assembled and ready to go out of the box and you’ll be printing models in 15 minutes. No need to spend weeks tinkering or fiddling to get average quality 3D prototypes with a cheap DIY 3D printing project, the UP! Mini 3D Printer is ready to go out of the box for either personal or professional 3D Printing. In order to create super large prints, simply slice your 3D models into sections, then print as components and glue together with nail varnish remover (acetone).</p>
    <p><img id="Img8" src="~/Images/3d_print_software.jpg" runat="server" class="imgleft" />The UP Mini comes with our easy to use Smart Visual Print Driver software. Just open up your STL (mos  3D CAD software packages can export to STL) – with the software you can rotate, scale and resize to your heart’s content. Much like a traditional 2D printer you can choose different settings, you can also choose your 3D print settings. Layer thickness, fill type (Honeycomb hollow or solid), quality and amount of Smart Support you want for each print.</p>
    <p> If that’s too much for you, don’t worry the default settings will work just fine by just clicking ‘print’!</p>

    <p>According to iRapid, the diameter of the nozzles is 0.4 millimeters, the individually applied layers are as little as 50 micrometers thin. At the same time the printer can process up to 100 millimeters per second.</p>

<p> notable feature of iRapid BLACK is the patented drive system. The printing plate is moved by rack and pinion drive; consequently, the device only consists of a few, very rugged components.</p>
